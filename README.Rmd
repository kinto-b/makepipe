# piper

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `piper` is to allow for the construction of make-like pipelines in R
with very minimal overheads. In contrast to `targets` (and its predecessor
`drake`) which offers an opinionated pipeline framework that demands highly
functionalised code, `piper` is catholic in approach, being adaptable to a wide
range of data science workflows.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kinto-b/piper")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(piper)
make_with_source(
  dependencies = c("scratch/data/0_raw_data.csv", "scratch/lookup/concordance.csv"),
  source = c("scratch/1 data_prep.R"),
  targets = c("scratch/data/1_data.Rds")
)
make_with_recipe(
    dependencies = c("scratch/data/1_data.Rds", "scratch/data/0_pop.Rds"),
    recipe = {
      usethis::ui_info("Merging...")
    },
    targets = c("scratch/data/2_data.Rds")
)
show_pipeline()
```

```{r out.width = "75%", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-example_pipeline.png")
```
