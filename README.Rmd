The goal of `makepipe` is to allow for the construction of make-like pipelines in R
with very minimal overheads. In contrast to `targets` (and its predecessor
`drake`) which offers an opinionated pipeline framework that demands highly
functionalised code, `makepipe` is easy-going, being adaptable to a wide range 
of data science workflows.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kinto-b/makepipe")
```
## Building a pipeline

To construct a pipeline, one simply needs to chain together a number of 
`make_with_*()` statements. When the pipeline is run through, each 
`make_with_*()` block is evaluated if and only if the `targets` are out-of-date 
with respect to the `dependencies` (and `source` file). But, whether or not
the block is evaluated, a segment will be added to the Pipeline object behind
the scenes. At the end of the script, once the entire pipeline has been run 
through, one can display the accumulated Pipeline object to produce a flow-chart
visualisation of the pipeline. For example:

``` r
library(makepipe)
make_with_source(
  dependencies = c("data/0_raw_data.csv", "lookup/concordance.csv"),
  source = c("1 data_prep.R"),
  targets = c("data/1_data.Rds")
)
make_with_recipe(
    dependencies = c("data/1_data.Rds", "data/0_pop.Rds"),
    recipe = {
      dat <- readRDS("data/raw_data.Rds")
      pop <- readRDS("data/pop_data.Rds")
      merged_dat <- merge(dat, pop, by = "id")
      saveRDS(merged_dat, "data/2_data.Rds")
    },
    targets = c("data/2_data.Rds")
)
show_pipeline(labels = c(
  "lookup/concordance.csv" = "Postcode concordance",
  "data/0_raw_data.csv" = "Raw survey data"
))
```
