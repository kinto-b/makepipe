## Resubmission
This is a re-submission. In this version I have:

* Replaced installed test files with tempfiles so that the tests only write to
the temporary directory

## Test environments
* local R installation, R 4.1.0
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.1.0
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
